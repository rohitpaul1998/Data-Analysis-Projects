**Boston Crime Analysis**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Setup a Dataproc cluster on Google Cloud, extracted raw data from Boston Crimes dataset using Hadoop and stored it on HDFS for distribution, resulting in a 50% decrease in data processing time
2. Performed data cleansing, transformation and loaded 300,000+ records in a PySpark dataframe using PySpark and processed the resultant data to CSV, reducing data redundancy by 15% and improving data accuracy by 90%
3. Leveraged a Hive database to store the cleansed data to conduct in-depth data analysis through querying and filtering the data, revealing key insights could potentially aid in criminal investigation and prevention
4. Automated the entire data processing pipeline using a Spark-submit job, saving approximately 2 hours of manual work and improving overall efficiency
5. Designed and implemented an end-to-end data pipeline in AWS using S3 for creating data lakes, Athena for data analysis, and Glue ETL jobs for transforming and loading structured data, thereby achieving a reduction in data processing time by 40%
6. Designing interactive dashboards on Power BI (in progress) which potentially reveals key insights on criminal activites

Tech stack: SQL, Python, PySpark, Hadoop, Spark, Hive, Google Cloud, AWS: S3 bucket, Glue, Athena

**New York City Food Inspection Analysis**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Analysed NYC food inspection dataset and identified data inconsistencies, data redundancies and its incompleteness
2. Performed data preparation and profiling by cleansing and transforming 200,000+ records of data in its raw state using Alteryx Designer and loaded the resultant data into staging tables in SQL Server, reducing processing and load times substantially
3. Designed a star-schema dimensional data model based on the NYC data using ER/Studio Data Architect, identified key facts and dimensions annd generated target database in SQl Server
4. Designed efficient data preparation pipelines to extract, transform and load data from staging tables into the integration schema using Alteryx that led to a increase in processing time by 10%
5. Created BI reports in Power BI to visualize data, incur actionable insights and presented a story that can make effective business decisions

Tech stack: SQL, SQL Server, Alteryx, ER/Studio, Power BI

**Disease Diagnosis and Medic Recommendation System**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Led a team of 4 and developed a MySQL database that recommends medical professionals for patients based on location, cost, gender, and education
2. Gathered structured data from Health websites and Twitter using web-scraping techniques, analyzed and transformed it with Python's Pandas and NumPy libraries achieving 98% data accuracy and data completeness
3. Loaded normalized database tables with clean data to eliminate data redundancy, created SQL views resulting in 100% database organization and visualized data using Seaborn library in Python that boosted our project to receive a 195/200 score

Tech stack: SQL, MySQL, Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn
